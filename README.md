ABC Company runs a small factory. The company employs workers who are paid one of
three hourly rates depending on skill level:

Each factory worker might work any number of hours per week; any hours over 40 are
paid at one and a half times the usual rate. In addition, workers in skill levels 2 and 3 can
select the following insurance option

Option Description Weekly Cost to Employee

Make an interactive Java payroll GUI application* that calculates the net pay for given factory
workers. All the basic information of the employees must be provided in the class
named as Employee. Apart from this, you can make use of appropriate OOP concepts
wherever possible, to enhance your code.
Input: It takes input data of given number of employees. The program prompts the user
for skill level and hours worked, as well as appropriate insurance options for the
employeeâ€™s skill level category.
Output: The applet displays: (1) the hours worked, (2) the hourly pay rate, (3) the
regular pay for 40 hours, (4) the overtime pay, (5) the total of regular and overtime pay,
and (6) the total itemized deductions. If the deductions exceed the gross pay, display an
error message; otherwise, calculate and display (7) the net pay after all the deductions
have been subtracted from the gross for all input employees.
